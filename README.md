```

##Example

```javascript
var timer = require('tellstick-timer');
ttd = timer();

// addNewTimer(lampId, timerId, onMin, onHour, offMin, offHour, callback);
ttd.addNewTimer(1, 47, 3, 1, 4, 1, function(err, lampId, timerId) {
  if (!err) console.log('Timer added/updated for lamp: ' + lampId + ' with timer ID: ' + timerId);
  if (err) console.log('Could not add timer. ' + err);
});

// removeTImer(lampId, timerId, callback);
ttd.removeTimer(1, 47, function(err, lampId, timerId) {
  if (!err) console.log('Timer removed for lamp: ' + lampId + ' with timer ID: ' + timerId);
  if (err) console.log('Could not remove timer. ' + err);
});
